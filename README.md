# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-Netflix-Movies-and-TV-Shows

This project focuses on the exploratory data analysis of Netflix's content library consisting of movies and TV shows. The dataset includes attributes like title, type, cast, country, release year, rating, genre, duration, and date added to the platform. The goal of this project is to uncover patterns and trends in content distribution, genre popularity, and regional diversity. Key insights were derived using visualizations such as pie charts, treemaps, bar graphs, and histograms. For instance, the majority of content on Netflix is movies, with drama and international content being the most prevalent genres. Additionally, a significant number of titles were added after 2016, showing Netflix's aggressive expansion. The analysis also involved handling missing values, type conversions, and feature extraction like parsing duration into movie minutes or seasons for shows.
